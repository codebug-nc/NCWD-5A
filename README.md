# MORE IF ELSE Practice

```JavaScript
if(condition){
  // do this;
} else {
  // do this;
}
```

## Let's write some If/Else Statements!
> You will be writing some JavaScript if/else statements to control the response to the users.

##### LOTTERY AGE 
- Ask the user how old they are
- Save the user's response as a variable called `age`
- Write an if/else statement:
  - **IF** the age is less than 18 use `alert()` to tell the user "Sorry, you can't buy lottery tickets."
  - **ELSE** use `alert()` to tell the user "I hope you win the lottery!!!"
  
##### SIBLINGS?
- Ask the user if they have any siblings.
- Save their response as a variable called `hasSiblings`
- If they say "yes", tell them "Nice, me too!! I have a lot of computer siblings." otherwise, say "That's cool!"

##### SWEET OR SALTY?
- Ask the user what kind of snack they want: sweet or salty.
- Save the response in a variable.
- Write an if/else if/else statement
  - **IF** the user says sweet, tell them "here's a cookie".
  - **ELSE IF** the user says salty, tell them "here's a bag of chips".
  - **ELSE** tell the user "I don't understand".


##### WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE SPORT?
- Ask the user which sport they like best out of basketball, hockey, or soccer.
- Save the response in a variable called `favoriteSport`
- Write an if/else statement
  - If the user says basketball, respond accordingly. Possible response: "basketball is pretty cool!"
  - Else if the user says hockey, respond accordingly
  - Else if the user says soccer, respond accordingly
  - Else (if) the user picks and invalid option (a sport that is not listed or a different response), respond with somethign like "I don't know that sport!"
- Check to make sure your code works.
- If everything works, comment out your code.

### CHALLENGE!!!

##### THIRSTY?/HUNGRY?
- Ask the user if they are hungry.
- Save the response as a variable.
- Ask the user if they are thirsty.
- Save the response as a variable.
- The if/else statements:
>(*hint* you will be using the `&&` and `||` symbols for this one.)
  - If the user is hungry and thirsty, give them a cookie and milk. 
  - If the user is hungry but not thirsty, give them a cookie
  - If the user is not hungry but is thirsty, give them milk
  - If the user is not hungry and not thirsty, tell them to go away.
  - Else tell the user they entered an invalid response.
